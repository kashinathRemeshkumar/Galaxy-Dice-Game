## 🌌 Game Overview

*Dice Galaxy* is a browser-based space travel game where the player rolls a dice to move forward in the galaxy. Random space events like wormholes, asteroid belts, and black holes make the journey unpredictable and thrilling.

Here, players are advance through space by rolling a dice, with each roll moving the spaceship forward by 1 to 6 units. The journey is filled with random space events triggered after each roll, including wormholes that launch the player 10 units ahead, asteroid belts that deduct 2 points from the score, and black holes that pull the player back by 20 units. These events are governed by probability, ensuring that no two journeys are alike and that each roll carries the thrill of the unknown.

Additionally, certain cells in the galaxy are designated as “Quiz Cells.” When a player lands on one, they’re presented with a question. If answered correctly, the spaceship is rewarded with a bonus move—skipping an extra 3 to 5 units forward. Incorrect answers don’t incur a penalty, preserving the normal flow of the game. This interactive mechanic adds a cognitive twist to the gameplay, blending chance with knowledge to propel players toward Planet Zeta.
